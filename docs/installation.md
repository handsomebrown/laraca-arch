# Install and setup

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require handsomebrown/laraca-arch
```

## Config file

If you want to depart from the default structure in this package, which I imagine many will, publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laraca-config"
```
