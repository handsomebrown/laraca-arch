# What is this for?

The goal of this package is a **configurable** Laravel application structure with a few niceties thrown in.
And I _swear_ that only tiny bits of my personal opinion made it into the default configuration. ;)

## Give over. What goes on here?

Laraca Architect overwrites and extends Laravel Artisan commands. Hence, they still have all of the arguments and options that original artisan commands do, but use the directory structure you define in the Laraca config file, adding some custom commands and additional options.
